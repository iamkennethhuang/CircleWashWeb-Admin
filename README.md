# Introduction
In this project, I will design a three-tier architecture web application for Circle Wash laundromat to increase customer loyalty, internal business productivity, and the operation's credibility. First, based on online reviews, customers have trouble filing complaints after business hours and experience difficulty getting a refund for machine malfunction. The website will provide fair online customer service handling customers' complaints. Increase internal business productivity; the website would offer scheduling services for picking up and dropping off laundries, eliminating staff picking up calls, and manually scheduling each laundry delivery. In addition, the scheduling service would provide an optimal delivery route for the driver to increase productivity. Lastly, the operation's policies and information are currently present to customers in posters scattered around the laundromat. A website can unify the details and communicate information clearly to the customers.
